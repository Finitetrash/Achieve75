                The Arkansas LEARNS Act states that public highschool 
                students must complete 75 hours of community service to 
                graduate. We, the students of IDEAcademy, 
                a microschool in Marion, have worked with an expert 
                to create a tool for highschoolers to find, and 
                document their hours.
